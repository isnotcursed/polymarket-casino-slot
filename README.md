## 🌟 What is PolyNanza?

**PolyNanza** is a candy-themed slot machine that transforms Polymarket prediction markets into a fun, interactive game! Spin adorable gummy bears and candy symbols while real-time market data determines your outcomes.

### 🔌 How It Works

The slot machine connects to Polymarket's API to fetch live prediction market data (BTC price predictions). 

1. **You click SPIN** → The game checks current market prices
2. **Places a bet** → Buys a position at current market price for your bet amount
3. **Waits for Bet Duration** → Holds the position for the configured time period
4. **Sells the position** → Closes the bet and calculates your profit/loss
5. **Animation plays** → Shows your winning (or losing) combination based on the result!

The real market odds influence your slot results, making it more than just random chance - it's tied to actual prediction markets!
