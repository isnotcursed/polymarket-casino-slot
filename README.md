## 🌟 What is PolyNanza?
**PolyNanza** is a candy-themed slot machine that transforms Polymarket prediction markets into a fun, interactive game! Spin adorable gummy bears and candy symbols while real-time market data determines your outcomes.

**🎮 Play with virtual balance** - The game includes a demo mode with fake money for safe entertainment. While there's API functionality for real market data, **we strongly discourage using it** - stick to demo mode for fun without risk!

## 🔌 How It Works

The slot machine connects to Polymarket's API and actually trades on live prediction markets (like BTC price predictions). Here's what happens when you spin:

1. **You click SPIN** → Game fetches current market price
2. **Opens a position** → Buys at current market price for your bet amount  
3. **Holds for Bet Duration** → Position stays open for the configured time period
4. **Closes the position** → Sells and calculates profit/loss based on price movement
5. **Animation plays** → Shows winning or losing symbols based on your actual trade result!

Your wins and losses are based on real market price movements - not random number generation. If the market moves in your direction, you win!
